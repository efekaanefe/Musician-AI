# Musician-AI
Using genetic algorithm from scratch and python package scamp to produce melodies with different instruments.
The user scores the melodies (*Which is really a tedious process*) and save them as MIDI files (*Not implemented yet*). 


## TODOs 
- [ ] Saving a melody as a MIDI file from the code itself (It is possible to use "MuseScore 3" which scamp supports) 
- [ ] If the user enters a invalid input, program closes. It shouldn't do.
- [ ] 
- [ ] I want to create multiple MIDIs and put them together to make a AI-Music.
