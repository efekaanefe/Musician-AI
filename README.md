# Musician-AI
Using genetic algorithm from scratch and python package scamp to produce melodies with different instruments.
The user scores the melodies (*Which is really a tedious process*) and save them as MIDI files (*Not implemented yet*). 


## TODOs 
- [ ] Saving a melody as a MIDI file from the code itself (It is possible to use "MuseScore 3" which scamp supports) 
- [ ] If the user enters a invalid input, program closes. It shouldn't do.
- [ ] I don't know what pitch corresponds to conventional notes. For example 70 -> C3 or something.
- [ ] Current algorithm uses duration and number of notes to be played. Change them to bars and notes per bar
- [ ] Play metronome sound on top of the melody playing.
- [ ] Create multiple MIDIs and put them together to make a AI-Music.
